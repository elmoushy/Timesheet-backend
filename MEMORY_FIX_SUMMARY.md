# Memory Exhaustion Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was experiencing PHP Fatal errors due to memory exhaustion (268435456 bytes = 256MB) when handling image data in the Support system. This was caused by:

1. Loading large binary image data into memory when fetching support records
2. Multiple image records being loaded simultaneously
3. Base64 encoding of images consuming additional memory
4. Inefficient memory management

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Model Optimization (SupportImage.php)
- **Modified `newQuery()` method**: Excludes the `image` column by default, preventing automatic loading of binary data
- **Added `withImageData()` method**: Allows explicit loading of image data only when needed
- **Updated `getImageDataUri()` method**: Loads image data on-demand instead of requiring it to be pre-loaded
- **Optimized `getHasImageAttribute()` method**: Uses file size instead of checking actual image data

### 2. Controller Optimization (SupportController.php)
- **Updated relationship loading**: Uses `supportImageWithData` only when image data is explicitly needed
- **Added memory limit increases**: Temporarily increases memory to 512M for image processing operations
- **Added garbage collection**: Calls `gc_collect_cycles()` after image processing
- **Added variable cleanup**: Unsets large variables after use
- **Optimized search method**: Removed unnecessary image_url access that was loading binary data

### 3. Model Relationship Optimization (XxSupport.php)
- **Added `supportImageWithData()` relationship**: Provides explicit control over when to load image data
- **Default `supportImage()` relationship**: Now excludes binary data by default

### 4. Memory Management Strategy
- **Lazy loading**: Image data is only loaded when explicitly requested
- **Temporary memory increase**: Memory limit is temporarily increased for image operations
- **Automatic cleanup**: Memory is cleaned up after image processing
- **Error handling**: Memory limits are restored even when errors occur

## Files Modified

1. **app/Models/SupportImage.php**
   - Added `newQuery()` method to exclude image data by default
   - Added `withImageData()` static method for explicit data loading
   - Updated `getImageDataUri()` to load data on-demand
   - Optimized `getHasImageAttribute()` to use size instead of image data

2. **app/Models/XxSupport.php**
   - Added `supportImageWithData()` relationship for explicit data loading
   - Kept existing `supportImage()` relationship for metadata only

3. **app/Http/Controllers/API/SupportController.php**
   - Updated `index()` method to use appropriate relationship based on requirements
   - Modified `getImage()` method to use `supportImageWithData` and added memory management
   - Updated `uploadImage()` method with memory management
   - Modified `store()` method with memory cleanup
   - Optimized `search()` method to avoid loading image data
   - Added error handling to restore memory limits

4. **MEMORY_OPTIMIZATION.md** (New file)
   - PHP configuration recommendations for better memory handling

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Memory Usage**: Image data is only loaded when explicitly needed
2. **Better Performance**: Faster loading of support records without image data
3. **Scalability**: Can handle more records without memory issues
4. **Controlled Memory**: Temporary increases only when processing images
5. **Error Prevention**: Proper cleanup and error handling prevents memory leaks

## Usage Examples

```php
// Load support records without image data (memory efficient)
$supports = XxSupport::with('supportImage')->get();

// Load support records with full image data (when needed)
$supports = XxSupport::with('supportImageWithData')->get();

// Get image data URI on-demand
$imageUrl = $support->supportImage->getImageDataUri();

// Check if image exists without loading data
$hasImage = $support->supportImage->has_image;
```

## Configuration Recommendations

Update your php.ini or .htaccess with the settings in `MEMORY_OPTIMIZATION.md` for optimal performance.

## Testing

Test the following scenarios:
1. Loading multiple support records without images
2. Loading support records with images
3. Uploading new images
4. Viewing individual images
5. Searching through support records

All operations should now complete without memory exhaustion errors.
