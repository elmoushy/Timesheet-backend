# JWT Authentication Implementation Summary

## Overview
All endpoints requiring authentication now use the JWT token system consistently. The application supports two types of tokens:

1. **Access Token** - Returned from `/auth/sso/exchange` as `'token' => $appToken`
2. **Refresh Token** - Used to get new access tokens from `/auth/sso/refresh` as `'access_token' => $newAccessToken`

## Authentication Middleware
- **JWT Middleware**: `jwt.auth` - Used for all protected endpoints
- **Middleware Location**: `App\Http\Middleware\JwtAuthMiddleware`
- **Registration**: Registered in `app/Http/Kernel.php` as `'jwt.auth'`

## Token Usage
All protected endpoints now require the JWT token in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

## Protected Endpoint Categories

### 1. SSO Routes
- ✅ `/auth/sso/me` - Already using `jwt.auth`
- ❌ `/auth/sso/exchange` - Public (token generation)
- ❌ `/auth/sso/refresh` - Public (token refresh)
- ❌ `/auth/sso/logout` - Public

### 2. Employee Management
- ✅ **Protected**: Create, Update, Delete, Bulk operations, Image management
- ❌ **Public**: List, Search, Show (read-only operations)

### 3. Support Management  
- ✅ **Protected**: Create, Update, Delete, Bulk operations, Image management
- ❌ **Public**: List, Search, Show (read-only operations)

### 4. Department Management
- ✅ **Protected**: Create, Update, Delete, Manager assignment, Employee tasks
- ❌ **Public**: List, Search, Show (read-only operations)

### 5. Client Management
- ✅ **Protected**: Create, Update, Delete, Bulk operations
- ❌ **Public**: List, Show (read-only operations)

### 6. Application Management
- ✅ **Protected**: Create, Update, Delete, Bulk operations
- ❌ **Public**: List, Search, Show (read-only operations)

### 7. Task Management
- ✅ **Protected**: Create, Update, Delete, Bulk operations
- ❌ **Public**: List, Search, Show (read-only operations)

### 8. Project Management
- ✅ **Protected**: Create, Update, Delete, Employee assignment, Bulk operations
- ❌ **Public**: List, Show, Tasks view (read-only operations)

### 9. Timesheet Management
- ✅ **Protected**: ALL operations (already within `jwt.auth` middleware group)

### 10. Time Management
- ✅ **Protected**: ALL operations (already within `jwt.auth` middleware group)

### 11. Department Manager
- ✅ **Protected**: ALL operations (already within `jwt.auth` middleware group)

### 12. Permission Management
- ✅ **Protected**: 
  - Pages: Create, Update, Delete, Status toggle
  - Roles: Create, Update, Delete, Status toggle  
  - User Roles: Create, Update, Delete, Status toggle, Bulk assign
  - Page Role Permissions: ALL operations
- ❌ **Public**: 
  - Pages: List, Show
  - Roles: List, Show, Get users/pages
  - User Roles: List, Show, Get user/role relationships

## Updated Controllers

### AuthController
- ✅ Updated `checkToken()` method to work with JWT authentication
- ✅ Updated `logout()` method to work with JWT (stateless tokens)
- ✅ Added proper JWT user retrieval from `$request->attributes->get('auth_user')`

## Authentication Flow

1. **Initial Authentication**: 
   - POST `/auth/sso/exchange` with Microsoft token
   - Returns JWT access token and refresh token

2. **API Access**:
   - Use JWT access token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
   - JWT middleware validates token and loads user

3. **Token Refresh**:
   - When access token expires, use refresh token
   - POST `/auth/sso/refresh` with refresh token
   - Returns new access token and refresh token

4. **Logout**:
   - POST `/auth/sso/logout` to revoke refresh token
   - Client discards JWT access token (stateless)

## Security Notes
- JWT tokens are stateless and cannot be revoked server-side
- Refresh tokens can be revoked server-side for security
- All write operations require authentication
- Read operations are mostly public for flexibility
- User account status is checked on every authenticated request
